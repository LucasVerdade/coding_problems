# Coding Problems
![Python Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3776AB?style=for-the-badge&logo=python&logoColor=white)  

Hi, stranger! ðŸ‘‹  
This is the repo where I post solutions to coding problems that I think they are interesting.  
Not all solutions are the optimal one. But my goal is to get better over time and resolve more problems.  
For now I'm using Python to solve them but I also want to write it in other languages like Javascript.
